ResQReact monitors device sensor data to detect potential falls and can notify pre-configured emergency contacts with the user's location, providing peace of mind.

## 🚀 Features

* 🤸 **Fall Detection:** Uses accelerometer and gyroscope data (`sensors_plus`) to detect fall patterns.
* 🔧 **Sensor Calibration:** Personalize sensitivity via calibration for improved accuracy.
* ⏰ **Emergency Alerts:** Countdown timer upon fall detection allows users to cancel false alarms.
* 📲 **Contact Notification:** Sends (currently mocked) alerts with location (`geolocator`) to emergency contacts.
* ⚙️ **Settings & Configuration:**
    * 👤 Manage user name.
    * 📞 Add/Remove emergency contacts.
    * 🎚️ Adjust fall detection sensitivity.
    * 💾 Settings saved locally (`shared_preferences`).
* 🔒 **Permission Handling:** Smoothly requests necessary permissions (`permission_handler`).
* 🏃 **Background Monitoring:** Basic capability to keep monitoring active when the app is paused.
